        <!-- Interview body text below -->
        <p>If you haven’t been to a Rosacade show yet, change that IMMEDIATELY. We got to see Rosacade with an amazing lineup of bands in the growing Midwest screamo scene, hosted by Heavy Extreme Midwest fest at the Logan-Avondale VFW.<br><br>
Always love to see shows go to the roots of DIY with events hosted at VFWs, American Legion halls, etc. In these truly polarizing times, there’s something cathartic about seeing veterans and the typical audience of DIY scenes sharing the same space. Despite the efforts of the pigs in office to divide and control us, spaces like this are a reminder we have more in common than we might think. We’re all striving to live a comfortable and happy life surrounded by kind people that want to uplift one another.<br><br>
I overheard the bartender talking to one of the VFW members at the bar saying, “It’s still early in the night, but yeah I think I’d do something like this again”. I even saw some regulars make their way back into the stage area and bang their heads to the music. And shoutout Heavy Extreme Midwest for their efforts to foster one of the safest show environments I’ve ever been to.<br><br>
Among an insane 11 band bill with 2 stages set up side-by-side festival style, Rosacade played the 7:30 timeslot to a packed room. The show starts with the two vocalists’ backs facing the crowd, everyone crowded in around the band on all sides. Guitar comes in first with a fast-picked arpeggiated riff, followed by a pause, and then a fruity “We’re Rosacade”, before mayhem ensues. Fast paced strumming and insane drumming with some fine cymbals. The screams were on point, with both vocalists in the pit the whole time, getting the crowd even more into it. And the thing that sets Rosacade’s music apart are the smooth transitions into a danceable beat for a few bars, before it’s right back into the havoc. Rosacade was a crowd pleaser and truly doing something special for Chicago’s scene.<br><br>
We chatted with them outside after the set and it was immediately apparent these guys have a great time together doing what they love. All standing in a circle, arms on each other’s shoulders, just happy to be sharing this experience.</p>

<div class="interview">

  <strong>Marco:</strong> I’m Marco, I’m the lead guitarist.</p>

  <p><strong>GRIN:</strong> How’d you guys get your start, or what was the start of rosacade?<br>
  <strong>Roland:</strong> Oh, okay, so it started as a solo project about a year and a half ago now. Just in my bedroom, going through mental shit, whatever, and then I’m like, damn, I want to play shows like, I want to be in a band. And so then, I found the original four members. Then we went through like hella member changes. We still have Glorp (Alex), he’s been the only OG, everyone else is new, but yeah it’s been a crazy journey with the music, like the music we made a year ago is the complete opposite of the music we make now. So it’s kinda chill.</p>

  <p><strong>GRIN:</strong> Is there a story behind the name?<br>
  <strong>Roland:</strong> Abel and I were on a call when I was trying to figure it out, like I wanted to make a bedroom project, whatever, and I couldn’t think of a name. He was like, bro just look up diseases or some shit. And so then I was looking at diseases and I saw rosacea, I’m like wait that’s fire. And then I misspelled it into Snapchat or something and I saw rosacade and I’m like wait that’s fucking fire. So that’s where it came from, a misspelling of rosacea.</p>

  <p><strong>GRIN:</strong> How do you describe your music to your parents?<br>

  <strong>Alex:</strong> Spread the positivity, always spread the positivity. I’m so glad this scene is growing. I'm so glad to see new bands coming in and just like hella young people getting involved.<br>
  <strong>Roland:</strong> There’s so many bands that are getting created from like our friends and people who’ve never met before. And there’s so many new faces at every show we play it’s so cool to be part of this growing community. It’s grown so much since a year ago. It's been awesome.</p>

  <p><strong>GRIN:</strong> Do you have any advice for others wanting to get into doing scream vocals?<br>
