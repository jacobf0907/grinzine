            We got to chat with Weeping after their bloodcurdling and anxiety-inducing set at Beat Kitchen along Gored Embrace, Vomit Forth, and none other than 200 Stab Wounds. Weeping are Theo (vocals, guitar), Bird (bass, vocals), Tom (guitar), and Jon (Drums), depressive homicidal death metal hailing from the land of no left turns, New Jersey. They released Spiritual Barbarism last year with punishing vocals, maniacal riffage, abusive double bass, and face-melting hammering drums. Here‚Äôs what went down:

GRIN: How‚Äôd you guys form the band?
Theo: It was me and Bird. We had an old band beforehand, and we were both just back and forth, giving each other the idea to do a death metal band. So that's how we started being a thing.

GRIN: What'd you guys do before? 
Theo: Oh we were playing in like a metalcore band. 

GRIN: How do you get your voice so high on vocals? Because you have a very different guttural, or scream, than a lot of others do.
Theo: Uh, I don't really know what I'm doing but it's just kind of how my voice is. I'm not doing a special technique, I'm just doing exhales, like normal, and I have something weird going on.

GRIN: What makes y'all's death metal homicidal? 
Theo: I think it speaks for itself, I mean, it sounds like it is, but that's like a bit we came up with while we were recording ethereal suffering. It was like, instead of depressive suicidal black metal, depressive homicidal death metal.
Tom: I mean, it's also fast and assaulting. I feel like people don't expect that, if they don't know us. And when it hits them it kind‚Äôve takes them by surprise, you know, it's very in your face.

GRIN: So, when you guys write songs, do you think lyrics, or do you just think of sounds on vocals?
Theo: I think of sounds and then attach lyrics to the sounds.You gotta get the phrasing right, because you could have awesome lyrics, but if you can't work it into the song, you know? I also don't think it's good if you can clearly hear the lyrics too often. Like a lot of death metal bands are ruined with, like very well-pronounced vocals. 
GRIN: Too clean cut, right? 
Theo: Yeah, it sounds bad. 

GRIN: Who‚Äôs some musical influences?
Theo: Oh, a lot
Bird & Theo: Hate Eternal, Cannibal Corpse, Nails, Dying Fetus
Jon: Slayer 
All: Slayer ñ§ê

GRIN: Love the collab with Bodybox, are you guys looking to work with more people? Anyone in particular?
Theo: No not in particular, like with Bodybox, Harry was just in the studio when we were recording. So we were just down to do something right then. Like our other feature is with Hunter and he was recording us. So like yeah, it‚Äôs just our friends.
Bird: If anything comes up, like yeah that‚Äôd be cool, but off rip not any in mind right now.

GRIN: Alright we gotta know this one, have you had Malort?
Tom: Yes
Theo: Uh, no
Jon: What is that?
GRIN: It‚Äôs a Chicago based liquor. It tastes like it‚Äôs made with a root, so it kinda tastes like shit. Usually start your night out with a shot of it.
All laugh
Theo: That‚Äôs awful, that‚Äôs funny.
GRIN: Tom, since you‚Äôve had it how do you describe it?
Tom: Jet fuel

SPEED ROUND

Who drives the worst?
Jon: Oh, don‚Äôt look at me.
Bird: Jon doesn‚Äôt drive the worst, he just drives New York style.
Theo: Yeah he drives New York style, but you can‚Äôt drive like that in a fucking sprinter van. I mean, you can‚Äôt safely.

Who got the stankiest breath?
Theo: Probably me.
Bird: He‚Äôs just stanky.
Theo: I‚Äôm just generally pretty bad smelling on tour.
Bird: Yeah, but not in general.
Theo: Yeah I‚Äôm good at home, I think, I don‚Äôt know.

Who got the most fortnite dubs?
Tom, he gets dubs.

Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja?
All say Fruit Ninja except Bird says Angry Birds, your guess is as good as mine.

Subway Surfers or Temple Run?
All say Temple Run, like true men of class.
